The pipeline has four main stages: 
* Aggregation: Community and in/outflow. Community based aggregation convert OD matrix between taxi-zone/subway-station to communities OD matrix. In/outflow aggregation eliminates OD information, but spatial granularity remain at taxi-zone / subway-station level. [1.CommunityDetection.ipynb](1.CommunityDetection.ipynb) is for community based aggregation, [1.IOAggregation.ipynb](1.IOAggregation.ipynb) is for in/outflow aggregation. Please download [combo](https://senseable.mit.edu/community_detection/) and compile at first before run community detection notebook.
* Dimension reduction. Include [AutoEncoder](2.AutoEncoder.py) and [PCA](2.StandardizeAndPCA.ipynb). Besides, 3 different normalization methods are included: standardization, whiten, and both.
* Anomaly detection. [3.AnomalyDetection.py](3.AnomalyDetection.py) is for anomaly detection, and [3_1.GMM_Component_Selection.ipynb](3_1.GMM_Component_Selection.ipynb) is for parameter tuning, you may ignore this file as the result is already implemented. We choosed GMM componenet which has the lowest bic score on taxi-zone/subway-station OD matrix.
* [Performance](4.ConfusionMatrixoutput.ipynb).
